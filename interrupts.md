# Discrepancies in Scheduler Simulation

## Overview

This document explains the discrepancies observed between the Expected Output provided in the assignment description and the Actual Output generated by the simulator.

These differences do not indicate a bug in the code. Instead, they are the result of implementing assignment's requirement to simulate realistic Operating System overheads, whereas the provided test examples assume an zero-overhead system.

Our simulator implements the following overheads, which increases the timeline forward significantly compared to the ideal examples:

| Operation                     | Overhead Cost | Components Simulated                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Switch**            | **14 ms**     | Switch (1) + Save (10) + Vector (1) + Load Addr (1) + IRET (1)                                                     |
| **System Call (I/O Request)** | **13 ms**     | Switch (1) + Save (4) + Vector (1) + Load Addr (1) + ISR Addr (1) + Driver (2) + Check (1) + Send (1) + IRET (1)   |
| **End I/O (Interrupt)**       | **13 ms**     | Switch (1) + Save (4) + Vector (1) + Load Addr (1) + ISR Addr (1) + Store (2) + Reset (1) + Standby (1) + IRET (1) |

Impact: Every time a process starts, stops, or requests I/O, the simulator adds 13-14ms of execution time that the idealized example ignores.
